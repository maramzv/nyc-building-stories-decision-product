"""Fast path for re-running just the story-profile logic (pattern, narrative,
backlog_age, long_unresolved, etc.) over the existing map_dataset.json,
without redoing the PLUTO join (lat/lon/floors/footprint) that
build_map_dataset.py always repeats from scratch.

Use this after a change to src/building_story.py that's pure logic/wording
and doesn't touch anything location-related - it reuses the raw violation
cache and the coordinates already sitting in data/map_dataset.json instead
of re-querying PLUTO's ~840 batches for all 167k buildings.

If you've added/changed which buildings are included, or need fresh
coordinates, use build_map_dataset.py instead.

Run: python scripts/refresh_map_dataset_profiles.py
