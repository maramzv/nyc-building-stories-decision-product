"""Discovery-phase analysis script — NOT part of the production pipeline.

Pulls the full process-timeline fields (inspectiondate, approveddate,
certifieddate, currentstatusdate, originalcertifybydate, newcertifybydate)
for a random sample of buildings, live from csn4-vhvf — these fields exist
in the source dataset but were never cached locally. Writes only to
data/violation_timeline_sample.json. Read-only against the live API and
existing data/map_dataset.json (for the buildingid population to sample
from); does not touch any production file.

See local project notes for why this was needed.
