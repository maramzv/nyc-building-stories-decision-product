"""Phase 4 extension: add a real neighborhood tier (city -> borough -> neighborhood -> building).

1. Pull all NYC Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) boundaries (dataset 9nt8-h7nd).
2. For every building in map_dataset.json, find which NTA polygon contains its
   lat/lon (point-in-polygon via shapely).
3. Add "neighborhood" to each building record.
4. Compute a neighborhood-level aggregate file (pattern breakdown per
   neighborhood, plus a centroid to fly to) for the map UI.

Run: python scripts/add_neighborhoods.py
Reads/writes data/map_dataset.json in place, writes data/neighborhoods.json.
