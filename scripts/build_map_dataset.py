"""Phase 4, step 1: build the dataset that feeds the 3D map visualization.

1. Take every building citywide that has at least one open HPD violation
   (~167,857 buildings - the full population, not a sample). IDs are
   shuffled with a fixed seed before batching so buildings with very high
   violation counts (some have 2,000+) get spread evenly across batches
   instead of clustering and risking the per-query row cap.
2. Pull their violation records (batched - too many buildingids for one
   query) and compute each one's six-dimension story profile.
3. Join each building to PLUTO (NYC's tax-lot dataset) for lat/lon and
   real floor count via borough+block+lot (batched, verified ~97.5% match
   rate in Phase 3 testing).
4. Export one JSON file: one row per successfully-profiled, successfully-
   located building, ready for the deck.gl/MapLibre frontend to read directly.

The violation pull is checkpointed batch-by-batch to a .jsonl file so a
30-60+ minute run can be killed and resumed without re-fetching completed
batches - see PARTIAL_PATH/PROGRESS_PATH below.
